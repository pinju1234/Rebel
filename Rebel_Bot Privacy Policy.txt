At Rebel_Bot, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains
how we collect, use, and share information when you interact with Rebel_Bot on
Discord. By using the bot, you agree to the collection and use of information as outlined
in this policy.
1. Information We Collect
When you interact with Rebel_Bot in a Discord server, the bot may collect and store the
following types of data:
• Discord User Data: We may collect basic information such as your Discord user
ID, username, and the server ID where the bot is being used. This information is
necessary to process your requests.
• User Requests: When you request TikTok content (e.g., videos or posts) through
the bot, we collect details related to the specific request to retrieve the correct
media from TikTok’s API.
• TikTok API Data: When you request TikTok content, we interact with TikTok’s API
to retrieve the requested posts. The bot does not store TikTok media but simply
fetches and presents it upon demand.
2. How We Use the Information
The information collected through Rebel_Bot is used solely to facilitate the bot’s
functionality and improve the user experience. Specifically, we use the data to:
• Process user requests for TikTok posts.
• Respond to user commands within Discord servers.
• Provide technical support and ensure smooth operation of the bot.
We do not use the data for any other purpose, and we do not store personal data longer
than necessary to provide these services.
3. Data Sharing and Third-Party Access
• TikTok Integration: Rebel_Bot integrates with TikTok’s API to retrieve content
requested by users. When a user makes a request, data is shared with TikTok
solely to fulfill that request. This interaction is subject to TikTok’s Privacy Policy.
• Discord Compliance: The bot operates within Discord’s platform, and by using
the bot, you also agree to Discord’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
We do not share user data with any other third parties or partners.
4. Data Retention
We retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill user requests and operate the bot.
No TikTok media or personal information is stored after the completion of a request. We
do not store any TikTok content, and any data collected for a specific interaction is
discarded immediately after the request is processed.
5. User Rights
As a user, you have the right to:
• Request access to any information we may have collected about you.
• Request deletion of your data or interactions with the bot.
To make such a request, contact us at [Your Contact Information], and we will respond
within a reasonable timeframe.
6. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect the data collected through Rebel_Bot from
unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration. However, please be aware that no
system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your
data.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices
or for legal or regulatory reasons. We will notify users of any significant changes by
updating the effective date at the top of this page. Your continued use of Rebel_Bot
